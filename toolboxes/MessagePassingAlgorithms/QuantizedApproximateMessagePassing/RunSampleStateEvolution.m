function mse = RunSampleStateEvolution
% Function runs State Evolution (SE) equations.
%
% SE predicts asymptotic MSE performance of Relaxed Belief Propagation and
% of Approximate Message Passing. 
% The channel model this script considers is that of AWGN followed by a 
% Quantizer. We consider signals distributed according to Gauss-Bernoulli
% distribution with some parameter rho. See paper text for details.
