% function [A AT B BT] = projection_srmblk(M,N,trans_mode,blksize,is_blocked,imsize,block_dim,Nb)
%
% Creates a set of funciton handles for both forward and backward random projections using 
% structured random matrices. This function uses the block mode SRMs. Utilizes the SRM

while Mleft >= N
	% Each 'sub' projection has a dimensionality one less than the original 
	% signal dimensionality. This is to avoid any odd processing errors from

% To do this, we need to sum together all the individual projections
